# magenta-clockwork-registration

This application was developed as a MVP for T-Systems as part of a university assignment in 2019.
It aims to provide access to a MySQL-DB via a REST-API and a basic in-memory-cache, build with Node, Express and Sequelize.
Additionally there are three frontends, that access the server in a repository pattern. Each of the frontends are built as a seperate Vue.js-Application.

You can register any number of visitors, which then would be rated in the backoffice.
The marketing workers would then look up the visitor in the Sales-view and innitiate a conversation at the actual fair.
The connection to the spirograph was cut out for the sake of this demo.
